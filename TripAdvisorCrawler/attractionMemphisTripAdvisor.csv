Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Courts0890,Loved it, ,50,September 2023
Graceland,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",Gracie696969,Wanted to visit for so long,"Wow been waiting over 40 years to visit, didn’t disappoint. Booked ultimate tour and we were first so the house was empty except us and our guide for quite some time. House is so Elvis those that adore him know the rooms, they were smaller than I thought but it fitted just amazing, the racquet ball course and music was emotional then followed by the graves. The tour was three hours we got separate bus just for us, our guide Bobby was great. We got to handle Elvis cape and a TCB ring. The tour after the house included another two Hours with Bobby over at the exhibits. Lunch included in the ticket at Vernon’s which was a nice meal and break. We then spent another 3-4 hours going round everything still to see. Negative was some of the staff were indifferent and not friendly which takes some shine off when you are so excited to visit.",50,August 2024
Graceland,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",M C,Memorable...bucket list wish fulfilled...,I love Elvis even more after visiting Graceland and the exhibit center. My 13 year old girls both loved it. Went for the candlelight vigil also... great moment...,50,August 2024
Memphis Zoo,"Zoos & Aquariums, Outdoor Activities, Nature & Parks",Lauren L,The.  Perfect.  Day.,"We've been before, but only with 8 kids in tow.  We went solo this time around.  The day was slightly cloudy & drizzly so there weren't many people there (it helped that it was Friday so most people were at work/school).  The dinosaur exhibit was open & that was a nice surprise!  We were able to just stroll around & take our time & be sweet.  It was very relaxing, in contrast to taking the kids haha.  Loved seeing all the exhibits & most of the animals were out.  There was a service dog & the lionesses tried to hunt it, which was crazy to witness so close.  Would 10/10 recommend.",50,March 2024
Graceland,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",dahlia8,Confrontational and Aggressive Tour Guide,Shoutout to our driver Rex! He was the superstar of the tour!,20,August 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",JoanneD219,Excellent tour and excellent tour guide,"John B was our tour guide for the ultimate vip tour. He was extremely knowledgeable about Elvis’s life and career. He had multiple stories behind the exhibits and we couldn’t stump him on questions!  The archive experience where we were up close with Elvis’s personal items (i.e., cape from his butterfly jumpsuit, TCB ring, onyx ring, leather belt, and others) was beyond our expectations. John gave us the background of every item. If you take a tour, ask for John. You won’t be disappointed.",50,August 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",cliff_taylor2,Worth the visit,"Enjoyed the tour, parking over the road only opened minutes before our tour time so felt a bit rushed, really enjoyed the walk through the house itself, I am not an Elvis fan at all but still enjoyed it. The exhibits opposite were OK but I felt like they had grabbed anything they could to pad out the exhibits. Glad we went.",40,July 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",TammyWilts,VIP ticket well worth the money, It's well worth it. We were there 6 hours so make sure you spend the day so you can see everything ,50,August 2024
Memphis Zoo,"Zoos & Aquariums, Outdoor Activities, Nature & Parks",944derekn,WELL worth the trip and price,"I've lived here almost my entire life since I was a kid in the 80's and have watched this thing grow to epic proportions.  I'm not just giving this zoo an excellent rating because I live here, I'm giving it that because I've been to many other zoos and this is by far the best one in the whole of the American south.  It's well worth the price of admission.  It's a lot of walking because it's so big however there are trams that ride through every part of the park you can hop on.  The keepers are great people too (I did my scuba certification class along with three of them that needed it for their jobs in the park, one of which was a girl that worked with the seals).  I go two to three times a year.  I've taken dates, family, friends, and co-workers and we've always had a good time.",50,August 2023

Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Claire L,Well worth a visit,"Highly recommend a visit here , our guide was great loved seeing all the authentic equipment that legends have played on , it's a great experience ",50,August 2024
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",TwinCreek,Bass Pro on steroids.  GREAT experience,"Bass pro on steroids.  After wandering around the amazing shopping area we stood in line for about 5 minutes for the elevator to the observation deck.  Be aware there is an $8 pp charge for adults, and a lesser charge for children.  Best viewing is at the river side of the deck through the dining area.  We had a po boy sandwich with fries which was great.  All staff were gracious, friendly and polite.  But BIG kudos to Toi, who helped take our food order while seated at the bar.  She went above and beyond with helping serve our party of 12 to include taking many group pictures, which was like herding cats.  We shared contact information should she ever travel to our home state.  Thank you , Toi, for making our visit more special.  Great staff and food.  Glad we made the trip.",50,June 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",RocketDan1,Wonderful visit,PS -  the PBB sandwhich with the bacon grease was money well spent!,50,July 2024
Memphis Zoo,"Zoos & Aquariums, Outdoor Activities, Nature & Parks",Tony R,Nice zoo,Great day at the zoo. Spent about 4 to five hours at the zoo lots to see very clean lots of different animals but not many of each. There where many indoor exhibits which was good way to get out of the heat.,50,July 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Patricia_Luz_Moreira,Learning about soul music makes my happy soul!,"Amazing experience to learn more about soul music. I was always curious to learn more about how soul music was born and to get the chance to visit such a place was really a blessing. So much talent, so much joy and soul. A really must go place when visiting Memphis",50,October 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",W3870AQpauliner,Stax giving it big stacks !!,"So full of information and memorabilia -  but so insightful and loved all the artifacts.  Such cool outfits, discs, and the car !! We loved it. ",50,October 2023
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Jessica Y,Definitely Worth Visiting,"Sun Studio is definitely a MUST if visiting Memphis.  Josh H. was the most amazing tour guide!  He was so knowledgeable, energetic, and fun.  We would recommend asking for him if you plan on visiting.  He will not disappoint!",50,July 2024
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",nancyr208,Graceland Gals trip,"This place was amazing.  The size was small but very welcoming.  The history of the building, the owner, and all the great musicians that recorded there was so very interesting.  Our tour guide, Josh H. Was the best.  Very knowledgeable and you could tell how much he loves what he does.  Definitely a place to check our when in Memphis!",50,July 2024

Big River Crossing,"Sights & Landmarks, Bridges",clpayne,Great way to spend an afternoon!,Well worth visiting Big River Crossing while in Memphis!,50,April 2021
Slave Haven / Burkle Estate Museum,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",bricecordellj,Do NOT waste your money,"Terrible! The staff was WAY too intense about our placement in the room to then leave us with a recording. The material presented was everything we already know about the slave trade. I would have loved to hear about the actual house and the family who risked everything to help free strangers from their oppression! Please research not only the family but any slaves who passed through and what they were able to accomplish when they gained their freedom! Also, skip the political rhetoric! Pushing division does no good! I would have given a 0 but TripAdvisor wouldn't let me!",10,June 2022
Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum,"Museums, History Museums, Specialty Museums",Jan S,Great Place,"Really enjoyed my visit here, very informative with some great music too.  You are given headphones and can go around at your own pace, loved walking round looking taking it all in.  If you love Rock & Soul it's well worth a visit!",50,April 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",Wendy C,Music History! ,This is a must do for music lovers! A treasure of history!! A close drive from town and easily done in 1.5 hours. Check it out! ,50,September 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",cruzfool2005ft,Really well executed overview of Memphis music,This was our first stop during our visit to Memphis and it gave a really informative overview of the history of music in this area.  I'd say its a must do while visiting to give you a background and understanding of the city and the music,50,September 2023
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Niven V,Musicians must go here!,"Lydia is an awesome tour guide. My family traveled from Australia to see Sun Studios. Lydia is funny and knowledgeable. This tour is a must for musicians, audio engineers and music enthusiasts.",50,July 2024
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Amy M,A must visit museum in Memphis!,Our visit at Sun studio today was fantastic! It was full of interesting anecdotes which really set us in the period of the studio's heyday. Our tour guide Lydia was extremely knowledgeable. Thank you for an unforgettable experience!,50,July 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",1960TN,Love every minute ,"We love the free walkup every morning from 7:30-8:30. Took the complete tour of house, museums and planes. Enjoyed everything. Take your time. Take photos. Very nice. ",50,June 2024
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",Sharon S,"Great bar and cocktails, recommend the tour","Highly recommend the tour if you're into history and learning about the distillery itself, and if not, definitely go to the bar, try a couple cocktails and make sure you get some chicken from Gus's across the street when you're there.",50,April 2022
Slave Haven / Burkle Estate Museum,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",782vicentef,Potential Unfulfilled,"This is an example of potential unfulfilled. The residence is a historic example of a safe house in the underground railway. The museum requires more focus and research. It should be a small museum with depth on the subject of the underground railway. Instead, it is small general museum on slavery in the United States, going over well-trodden subjects in a rather shallow fashion. It is surprisingly short on research of the safe house, its inhabitants and how did it fit in the larger scheme of the underground railway. Thus, there is not much information as to what drove the Burkle family into risking their lives to operate the safe house. There is not even a simple family genealogy depicting what happened to the different family members during and after the civil war. Basic research would include perusing census data, property rolls, tax and business records, among others.",20,October 2021
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",paulsH525UC,Great for Soul music buffs,"If you love American Soul music, Southern or Memphis style, then this is the place for you. Not a large museum but full of history and artifacts. And they did a nice job restoring the recording studio back to its original luster. ",40,September 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",cbritt22017,Worth your time to breathe Soul history!,I appreciated the video at the beginning as it sat the stage for the history shared.  It’s not a huge museum but so much packed in.  The tour culminates in the recording room where the magic happened.  Well worth the small adult fee to experience and listen to the golden age of soul especially in a nice air conditioned space out of the heat of Memphis in July.,50,July 2023
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Inspire339419,Best in Memphis,"Tour was awesome!!!  Entertaining, informative and super fun.  Josh H. Was our tour guide and made it unforgettable.  Best tour in Memphis!",50,July 2024
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Gene A,Outstanding Tour of Memphis Music History,"The Sun Studio Tour given by Graham, our tour guide, was fabulous. It was our first time there and he made it memorable. He was easy going, kind, funny and extremely knowledgeable. He used what special effects they had with ease and a sense of humor. When we got to the famous studio, he started off that segment of the tour with some of his piano playing which was outstanding! I wanted him to keep playing. He made music history come alive. Lastly, it was so much fun getting to hold one of the most famous microphone stands in history. He answered all questions and he was fun to be around. I wanna go back and do another tour maybe next year! Thanks Graham!!! God Bless. Very Respectfully, Gino",50,June 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Katlin K,See how the star lived,"We had a great self-guided tour through the grounds and mansion at Graceland. It was a very thorough tour and easy to maneuver getting to the venue. There is a ton of parking and a lot to see before you head out on the bus across the street to the house. Be sure to take it all in! Lots of walking, reading and sights to see.",40,March 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",monkeycat5,Elvis,Graceland Mansion and the other attractions in the complex were interesting and fact filled.   We enjoyed our visit and all the great displays.    Unfortunately they oversell tickets for the mansion tour.  Bought tickets online to avoid the line.  Had to choose a time for the tour.   Got there well before our scheduled time.   When our SCHEDULED time came we had to wait for 20 minutes just so they could send us to a theater room and wait longer.  They finally shuttled us to the mansion.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes in the sun because they overbook the tour.  It was over an hour later than our purchased time when we finally entered the mansion.   Not acceptable.,40,June 2024
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",johnkU9774ZP,Buyer be ware,"The bartender is a fantastic story teller--quite entertaining.  Loved the tasting and all of the info on alcohol, especially bourbon .  The distillery doesent actually distill--not quite sure where it is done, but this facility is non functioning.  You can purchase a liter of Old Domimic vodka at any liquor store for $20.  However, at the tour they charge $27.  Buyrer be ware.",30,June 2020
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",644meghanm,Can’t Wait to Visit Again!,Really enjoyed our visit to Old Dominick! Drew was a great tour/taste guide and we enjoyed the variety of alcohol offerings and educational tidbits. Fun atmosphere with cozy couches and decor. Would certainly recommend for anyone interested in supporting a local business with a unique and interesting history!,50,March 2021
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",windsgroup,Most Memorable Experience of Soul Music,"This is a must stop to understand the history of soul music, which is a blend of country, gospel and  blues all blended together. So many artists worked to make Stax records a wonderful record label. The vibrant history was overwhelming from the church’s in the Deep South to the Bible Belt. This is a must stop in Memphis,",50,June 2023
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Susan T,A MUST Memphis visit,"Graham our guide was a fountain of knowledge with a great repor in musical detail, stories and humour. We all in our group from the UK had a great time and experience.",50,June 2024
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",123joei,Amazing Graceland,This was our 5th time visiting Graceland and we enjoy it more every time. The Ultimate VIP tour is well worth the cost. FYI you can do a walk up to the Meditation Garden at 7:30 AM. It allows for you to visit the graves without the crowds.,50,May 2024
Big River Crossing,"Sights & Landmarks, Bridges",Anthony W,Great way to experience the River.,"This is a cleverly designed bridge for pedestrians and bikes, also scooters.We rode Explore bikes over and back and it was quite enjoyable with great views. Nice way to get exercise and see the city from a different point of view.",50,June 2019
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",Sylvie521,Enjoyable tour - worth a stop,"We came here after eating at Gus's across the street.  We had just missed a tour and had to wait an hour for the next tour which allowed us time to walk down to the river.  The tour is very informative.  Loved the history of the toddy!  Great stories about this family.  The whiskey is not yet ready as it has to age for 4 years and there are 2 years to go.  You get to see the process along the way and end your tour at the bar with 7 tastings including the moonshine, vodka, gin, toddy, bourbon, 1 year and 2 year whiskey.  I really enjoyed the honeybell vodka and the toddy.  Both are available for sale in the gift shop as well as many other items.  There is a nice bar if you just wish to have a drink.  Super clean and everyone is very nice.",40,August 2019
Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum,"Museums, History Museums, Specialty Museums",Brenda A,Not Worth the $8,Super small and not interactive. It felt like an extension of the Hard Rock. Walked through the Hard Rock gift shop on the way out.,10,February 2023
Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum,"Museums, History Museums, Specialty Museums",673virginiak,Very enjoyable,As an addition the T-shirts here in the shop are better quality than we have seen elsewhere.,50,February 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Patrick M,concerned,I loved the tour up until the gift shop. I was treated as if I was about to steal something and checking out was very insencensere. It wasn't a very welcoming experience.,30,May 2023
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Libby T,Magic was created in this small space!,"This is a fabulous museum that showcases the talented musicians that came together, white and black, o create magic at a time when Black Americans had little opportunity to improve their lives.  The owners of Stax, along with talented people like Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. And the MGs created songs that I grew up hearing.  Lots to see, but worth every minute.",50,April 2023
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Paradise631333,Take This Tour!!,"The Sun Studios tour was fantastic! Josh H. was our guide and he did an incredible job of bringing the history of Sun Studios to life! The tour was fun, informative and there was plenty of time at the end for the guests to take their own time for pictures or just to take it all in. Highly recommend!!",50,June 2024
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",577SusanH,Unique Place,"We just had to check this place out and I’m glad we did. The story behind how this pyramid was once an events venue and how it became a Bass Pro Shop is interesting. I even looked up on line to see pictures of the building prior to being a pro shop. The transformation is amazing. We went to the observation deck, and yes it was a little pricey to go up at just under $9 each with taxes, but we had to do it once. The view was great! We also decided to have a drink and appetizer at “The Lookout” a restaurant and bar at the top. The store was so amazing with so much to see. Besides shopping for everything outdoor, there were ponds full of large fish, a hotel, a restaurant and even a bowling alley. You got to check it out at least once!",50,May 2023
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",WuffWuffTraveler,Dogs were better behaved than the kids ,"We didn't do the pyramid ride to the top, but a lot of people said it was fun. Great way to spend the afternoon and spend money while creating memories. Thanks!",40,May 2023
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",anitasK981RZ,Awesome place,We really enjoyed visiting the Pyramid. Hard to believe it use to hold basketball games. It had so much to look at. The line for the elevator ride was long but worth it. You are able to see a lot from high above the ground. We did not eat there but would go back to eat at Wahlburgers and to go bowling in the fish bowl. We really did not go to shop but to mainly see the sights. Most definitely come back and try and stay in the lodge and eat for sure.,50,May 2023
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",debishrek,Wonderful Experience,"Really nice and informative tour, very classy place to visit.  Nice tasting at the end of the tour.   I highly recommend this. ",50,August 2018
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",john7002017,Great Piece of Memphis History,"Love history and wasn't disappointed with this tourist stop. Live within two hours and this was worth the trip for something to do in Memphis.  The distillery is spotless, the staff are gracious, knowledgeable and welcoming. Learned much about Memphis history, Distilling, Tennessee history, and the contributions of late 1800's immigrants to west TN.  Even the tasting at the end was more than just trying different liquors. It was a detailed learning experience. Trying raw whiskey straight out of the still, in the barrel for 1 year and then 2 year, was a unique journey into how whiskey is produced and where the complex flavors come from.  Sorry this tour is not for those under 21 but is great for the history buff or anyone interested in how alcoholic beverages are made even if you are a non drinker. You don't have to participate in the tasting.  Also if you are not a history professor type this was by no means a dry boring tour (all puns intended, sorry!), it moved along at a good pace, there was enough time for questions and everything was well presented.",50,June 2019
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",cheeseheadfamilyof4,Great tour and tasting,"We really enjoyed this tour.  It gives some great history, hits the high points of distilling, and doesn't drone on forever.  The curated tasting at the end is well done and you get to try 7 different things.  High quality spirits.  One of the best things we did in Memphis.",50,June 2019
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",thedoms,Fascinating tour,"The location of the distillery was easily walkable from the Peabody and the facility itself was extremely nice. The tour was interesting and informative, without suffering from overkill like many tours of this type. There was a tasting session at the end. The co-located shop had a variety of items to purchase. ",50,July 2019
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",runnerrich,A must see,This is a great museum. Even if you are not into music history this museum should be on your to do list if you go to Memphis. They do a great job reliving the history of the musicians and staff behind STAX. Great instruments on display also. Learned a lot during my visit.,50,December 2022
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Tammy Y,Wonderful Tour with an awesome Tour Guide - Drew!,The Sun Studio tour was fantastic.  We learned a lot.  Some things I did already know but it was so cool to stand where my all time favorite artist (Elvis) stood.  Along with all the other greats.  BUT what made the tour even better was our awesome tour guide Drew!!!  He definitely made the tour top-notch.  He was so engaging and has such a great personality.  I highly recommend the Sun Studios tour!,50,May 2024
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",scott r,Few things can be called unique - this is one,"For the price of $0 this is a wicked fun place to walk around.  Everything you might need to shoot, spear or otherwise kill an animal and the clothing to do it in.  Store is endless and I almost walked out with things I really didn't need.  Did not do the observation deck, but great fun even so.  Apparently there's a hotel and restaurant in there too.",40,May 2023
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",Tim W,Good rainy day activity. Skip if the weather is nice.,"We were hoping for an interesting experience here and were a little underwhelmed. The dome of the pyramid makes the entire place seem dark. My daughter and I took the elevator to the observation decks. It was interesting to see the skyline of Memphis from that height, but I don't know that it was worth the cost to get up there for the sites.",20,March 2023
Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",JmarriedJ,Not worth the hype,"We were told to visit here by many people and told that even if we were not into hunting and fishing it was great. I disagree. Unless you want to pay for all the extra things it is not worth it. I’m sure it is great for some, just not our cup of tea.",30,April 2023
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",danders1999,Loved the visit!  Super friendly and fun,We opted to bypass going on a tour after already walking around town all day.  Sat at the bar and visited with the bartenders and a couple brewers just off-shift.  Really loved the fresh-made drinks and the fun conversation.  Great place.  Great drinks...beer too!,50,March 2019
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",Omar R,Super friendly and great service!,We just came for some appetizers and some drinks. Awesome bar with a back window that possesses a million dollar view of the bridge. The drinks are great and the service is super fast. We were there on a weekday so not a lot of people but it was very trendy and elegant.,50,March 2019
Old Dominick Distillery,"Food & Drink, Distilleries",Elizabeth B,Great distillery tour and tasting,"We visited with a Road Scholar group, had a great tour guide/host named Conner.  Learned a lot about the history of the distillery and the family, also the distilling process.",50,April 2019

Slave Haven / Burkle Estate Museum,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",nicolag163,Absolute must experience!!,"In one hour this place gave us that understanding. It’s not a dry museum, the exhibits are just props for the story you are told as guided round. The gentleman who was our guide was a credit to this place, such an inspirational speaker, we didn’t want to stop listening! We were both shocked and ashamed to hear of the Europeans involvement, no wonder we hide this terrible history back home. Come and learn. I recommend this as an experience you’ll not forget.",50,November 2019
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",cgoggins2018,AMAZING!!!!,I absolutely loved this place...The host was the sweetest and very helpful... We really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end it is definitely a must to vist when in the area,50,October 2022
Sun Studio,"Sights & Landmarks, Historic Sites",Mike H,You cannot miss this when you visit Memphis!,"When we arrived we were greated by very friendly staff.  We had about 30 mins to wait and they suggested a couple places near by to kill the time.  There is also a souvenir shop and coffee and beverage bar.   That was very helpful so you are not just standing around.  Graham was our guide.  Right from the start he was very energetic and engaging.  Graham was an awesome guide.  He was very informative and told you things that were more then just what was on display.  When he took us into the actual studio he was playing the piano.  Was so cool and he is very talented.  We are so glad we did this and highly recommend.   Graham if you read this ""rock on""!",50,May 2024

Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid,"Shopping, Gift & Specialty Shops",therustictraveler,A pyramid in Memphis!,Memphis pyramid! It’s a Bass Pro Shop within a pyramid. What more can you say?? Definitely have to visit even if you’re not that much into outdoor sportsmen activities. The inside is awesome. It looks and feels like you’re in a lagoon but it’s also a store! You can walk around for quite a bit. You can also take the elevator to the top observation area. It costs a ticket or you can make a restaurant reservation. The day we went the line was fairly long.,40,January 2023
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Brian L,Graceland,I’m not a big Elvis fan but this trip/ tour was excellent. Would definitely go again. I came out of the house into the garden where Elvis & family members were laid to rest & I was on my own & I felt really emotional. The scale of what Elvis achieved was incredible and in the museum across the road is also definitely worth visiting.,50,June 2023
Graceland,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",BlackRoseCher,Take The Ultimate VIP Tour,"We took the Ultimate VIP Tour. The best. Small group with a great guide. Didn’t have to wait in any lines. Tour guide very informative. We also got to do the white glove experience, which was neat. After the tour we had a great lunch at Verons Smokehouse. Which was included in the price. Well worth the money.",50,May 2024
Graceland,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",Loud1Canberra,A must do but so commericalised,One issue is the incredible amount of Elvis memorabillia and goods. It felt like it was all about the money not his life and contribution to music and charities.,30,April 2024
Graceland,"Sights & Landmarks, Museums",Brumjam,Memorable Experience,A must visit location if you find yourself in Memphis.,50,May 2024
Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum,"Museums, History Museums, Specialty Museums",mommysbored2,Interesting,"When you enter and pay there is a 12 minute video to watch, it was okay. Then you are given a player with headphones to use throughout the self guided tour.  We really didnt feel the information added anything to our experience so we stopped using the headphones after the first few times. It was interesting but we thought it could have been paid out better, it seems there were exhibits that had nothing to do with the Rock of Memphis and would have been better displayed in a civil rights museum.  Just our opinion.  We were only in there about 1.5 hours tops and it is much smaller than we expected which is fine but we were expecting more since the Civil Rights museum had so much reading.  You get to see costumes from the singers which is cool. ",40,January 2022
Slave Haven / Burkle Estate Museum,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",Beth P,Very informative ,"I visited Slave Haven while in Memphis recently and it far exceeded my expectations. I’ve been to museums throughout the US and a few other countries and honestly this is one of the most informative museums I’ve ever visited. The displays were very moving and really brought to life by Greg, our guide through the museum. I’d recommend this to anyone visiting Memphis. ",50,October 2019
Slave Haven / Burkle Estate Museum,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",sheilarz12,Very enlightening ,My husband and I took the tour today. We were very impressed with the quality of the tour.  The tour is loaded with information that is even relevant to today’s society. It was heartbreaking to hear some of the stories. It was amazing taking a look at the quilts and all of the photos at the house.  The visit to the cellar where the slaves hid was my favorite part. To think that I was standing where heroes from the past had stood.  People who were so brave!  I was humbled by the experience. I highly recommend this tour. It would be good for older children as well.  ,50,October 2019
Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"Museums, Sights & Landmarks",robsR6939LC,Just okay,Heard so many good things about Stax couldn't wait to see it but not as good as we hope.  I like Soul music but more of a rock n roll fan.  It was a lot of reading for something I am really not into.  We really enjoyed the movie at being of tour.,30,September 2022
